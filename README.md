# FlappyBird
## Recreating the game "Flappy Bird" using Java
This game illustrates almost the original Flappy Bird with selectable difficulties by pressing number keys(1-3). The user needs to control the bird to fly upwards by pressing the spacebar or let it drop to a certain height in order to pass the gap between a pipe. Passing each pipe will gain one point, and the game will ends when the bird hits the pipe.
